### 2.MU-MIMO

Multiple-input and Multiple-output (MIMO) is a system that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to improve communication performance. SU-MIMO involves transmitting one or multiple streams to one user at a time. MU-MIMO involves transmitting one or many streams to more than one user at a time in the same set of frequency resources.

The following are the benefits of MU-MIMO over SU-MIMO:  

- Supporting multiple clients at the same time can improve overall DL throughput per client.
- With 2 to 3x greater efficiency for MU clients, the network has more “free” time or capacity to serve other clients. Important for enterprise network.

802.11ax does not require explicit grouping with a MU-MIMO GID management frame. The HE-SIG-B contains the information required by the receiver to determine whether and how it should decode the incoming PPDU. Any user combination of STAs can receive an 802.11ax MU-MIMO PPDU.
11AC explicit grouping with a MU-MIMO GID management frame.

> A VHT beamformee that transmits a VHT Compressed Beamforming frame shall set the Feedback Type field in the VHT MIMO Control field to the same value as the Feedback Type field in the corresponding STA Info field in the VHT NDP Announcement frame. If the Feedback Type field indicates MU, the STA shall send a VHT Compressed Beamforming frame with the Nc Index field value in the** VHT MIMO Control** field equal to the minimum of all of the following.    
The VHT MIMO Control field is included in every VHT Compressed Beamforming frame. VHT MIMO Control field is used to indicate compressed beamforming feedback matrix.    

> 19.3.12.3.6 Compressed beamforming feedback matrix  
In compressed beamforming feedback matrix, the beamformee shall remove the space-time stream CSD in Table 19-10 from the measured channel before computing a set of matrices for feedback to the beamformer. The beamforming feedback matrices, found by the beamformee are compressed in the form of angles, which are sent to the beamformer. **The beamformer might use these angles to decompress the matrices and determine the steering matrices Q.**  

> On receiving the sounding PPDU, STA A uses the resulting channel estimate to compute steering matrices and **uses these matrices to send a steered PPDU back to STA B**.
