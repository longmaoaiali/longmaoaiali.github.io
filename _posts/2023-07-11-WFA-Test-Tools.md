### 1.Acronyms

**WFA**: Wi-Fi Alliance  
**WTS**: Wi-Fi Test Suite  

----------

### 2.WFA Certification Paths

Wi-Fi CERTIFIED products have undergone rigorous testing by one of three certification paths:

- **FlexTrack**: Tailored to sophisticated product design built from the ground up. FlexTrack allows the most flexible Wi-Fi functionality customization built into components. Testing is completed at an Authorized Test Laboratory (ATL).

- **QuickTrack**: Tailored to products based on components that have already completed full Wi-Fi functionality testing in a Qualified Solution. QuickTrack allows targeted changes to Wi-Fi functionality. Testing can be completed at an ATL or member testing site. Programs for which QuickTrack is available include: Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6® and Wi-Fi 6E operation, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED ac, Wi-Fi CERTIFIED n, Wi-Fi Agile Multiband​™, Wi-Fi Data Elements™, Protected Management Frames, WPA2™, WPA3™, Wi-Fi Enhanced Open™, Wi-Fi Protected Setup™, and Wi-Fi Direct®.

- **Derivative**: For copies of a Wi-Fi CERTIFIED device Source Product, such as the same chipset used for multiple laptop models. Members may apply for certification of derivative products without the testing requirement.

### 3.Wi-Fi Test Suite

Wi-Fi Test Suite is a software platform developed by Wi-Fi Alliance to support certification program development and device certification. Wi-Fi Test Suite is used by ATLs to certify Wi-Fi Alliance members’ products primarily utilizing the **FlexTrack certification path.** 

Wi-Fi Test Suite is an integrated platform that automates testing Wi-Fi components or devices. Wi-Fi Test Suite provides the following services:

    Configure - Automatically configure devices to execute test cases.
    Traffic Generation - Generate traffic streams with specified parameters.
    Test - Execute test scripts by controlling test bed device operation.
    Results Analysis - Determine pass/fail results based on a given test case or script criteria.

### 4.QuickTrack Test Tool  

The QuickTrack Test Tool software provides conformance testing based on Wi-Fi Alliance test plans using the **QuickTrack certification path**.   

The QuickTrack Test Tool is tailored to test and certify products based on Qualified Solutions that **have already completed full Wi-Fi® functionality testing—modules, chipsets, and other solutions developed by Solution Providers**, which have undergone the prerequisite interoperabilty and conformance testing.
