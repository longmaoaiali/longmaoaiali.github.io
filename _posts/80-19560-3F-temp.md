### 5.MBSSID capabilities 

Multiple BSSID or mBSSID is an AP feature that enables creation of multiple virtual Access Points using a single physical radio.   
This will allow configuration of multiple infrastructure networks, each IS with different BSSID and different access characteristics like security mode and access control configurations.  

6 GHz AP that supports Multi BSSID and advertising partial list of non-Tx BSSID profiles is required to be an Enhanced Multi-BSSID Advertisement (EMA AP).  

### 6.6GHz

As of April 2020, FCC opened up 1.2 GHz of unlicensed spectrum for Wi-Fi use. This will be identified under 'Wi-Fi 6E' for certification.   

**CSA**: An AP and its connected stations (if applicable) must be able to switch between 5GHz and 6GHz bands seamlessly without reassociation.  
**DFS**: Enable random channel selection policy within and across bands. Additionally, ensure that Agile DFS is aware of both bands of operation.  
**Security**: Ensure seamless channel switching across the 5GHz and 6GHz bands only if operating security mode is identical.   
**MBSSID**: Ensure the multi-VAP radios (also known as Multi-BSSID or MBSSID) are seamlessly transitioned to the new band.  
**Security**: 6GHz band supports only Open and WPA3 modes.   

### 7.OBSS_PD spatial reuse 

Refer to `26.10.2 OBSS PD-based spatial reuse operation` 

The OBSS_PD spatial reuse functionality is supported. To increase user data, APs are being set up with reduced cell size. However, the de-sense area of the STA is large due to requirement to defer at minimum sensitivity.   
In dense environments, packets from OBSS AP/STA that are weak, may prevent AP/STA in BSS for transmission. A 6-bit random code in the preamble enables the BSS PHY to quickly recognize the OBSS reception. When signal is weak enough, the BSS AP/STA will transmit over it without disturbing communication in both BSS and OBSS.   

If OBSS_PD is enabled with valid threshold (in the range -82 dBm to -62 dBm), then monitor VAP does not capture packets below the threshold. 

`The HE-SIG-A field for an HE SU PPDU or an HE ER SU PPDU contains the fields listed in Table 27-18.   B8–B13 BSS Color 6 An identifier of the BSS.`    
`WMI_PDEV_PARAM_SET_CMD_OBSS_PD_THRESHOLD`

### 8.Max BSS idle time support
The Max Idle Period field of the BSS Max Idle Period element indicates the time period during which a STA can refrain from transmitting frames to its associated AP without being disassociated. 

### 9.Off-channel Tx and Rx  

Off-channel Tx feature enables sending frames on a different channel than the current operating channel. This functionality uses scan mechanism to go to foreign channel and then sends the frame.   
This section describes the lower-level details of APIs and functions provided to achieve this capability. This section helps in understanding the changes related to off-channel Tx on the Host software codebase. This section describes the functionality/services provided by off-channel Tx.    

### 10.Ring Operation

	htt_h2t_rx_ring_cfg() //config ring in host to adapte different chip 
	enum hal_ring_type { }
	enum hal_srng_ring_id { }

### 11.LMAC ID in data path

REO rings are not PDEV specific, so no remapping operation is required. Buffer replenish is performed by queuing to the appropriate refill LMAC ring, so it is important to select the lmac ID while accessing the refill ring after a mode switch. This is handled automatically because of the way rx buffers are initialized. Since the rx refill ring is moved to soc domain and is accessed via lmac id, the rx descriptor pool is now also associated with the same lmac id. A call to `dp_pdev_rx_buffers_attach` ties the refill ring to the descriptor pool.In dp_rx_pdev_attach(…)

In receive path: `dp_rx_process()`   

- Rx descriptor is derived from cookie.  
- Pool id derived from `rx_desc` is the `lmac_id` used during init. So the `"rx_bufs_reaped"` count indicates buffers reaped from appropriate hardware lmac.  
- During replenish, `mac_id` corresponds to the lmac whose buffers were reaped.    

In Transmit path: 
The lmac_id stored in pdev is being used to setup lmac_id in TCL descriptor, which will be updated by cdp_soc_map_pdev_to_lmac API during mode switch. Also, in the HTT layer of the transit path, target PDEV ID must be obtained from host PDEV ID.


#### 12.IEEE 802.11 standard features 

#### 12.1.802.11n(high throughput) features  

 A-MPDU  
 A-MSDU

##### 12.1.1.A-MPDU aggregation (peer feature negotiation)

The 802.11n specification defines the protocol for negotiating A-MPDU aggregation parameters with a peer. This negotiation is bi-directional; that is, each peer has to agree to receive A-MPDU aggregates. Each peer that wants to transmit A-MPDUs sends a request to the other side to establish resources for receiving aggregates. If the other side accepts the request, it will respond with a positive acknowledgment, and specify the resources it has available for receiving an aggregate. A-MPDU aggregation is implemented as a sliding window, called a **Block ACK Window (BAW)**, over a sequence number set. Each peer specifies the number of buffers it has available for reordering packets. This number cannot be exceeded by the sender. **Note that aggregation is negotiated independently for each TID being used between a pair of peers.** The capability exchange and negotiation is termed **“ADDBA exchange”**.
After the negotiation is completed successfully, the sender can send aggregate MDPUs (A-MPDUs) to the receiver.

<img src="/img/post/2023-07-31-block-ack-mechanism.png"/>  

##### 12.1.2.A-MSDU aggregation  

A-MSDU aggregation is another way of aggregating packets. **The sender packages multiple Ethernet packets into a single wireless packet and queues** it for transmission. When the receiver gets this packet, each component packet is extracted and handed up to the protocol stack. A-MSDU aggregate reception is mandated by the 802.11n standard for the normal ACK policy and is negotiated when using A-MPDU (Block ACK). Transmission of A-MSDUs is optional. The 
presence of an A-MSDU aggregate is indicated by the AMSDU bit in the QoS header. **A-MSDU size is restricted to a maximum of either 3839 or 7935 bytes, and the value to be used is provided in the HT-Capabilities IE**. The Qualcomm driver restricts it to 3839 bytes for receive. Note that A-MSDUs can be aggregated into A-MPDUs

Each packet (sub-frame) that is aggregated into an A-MSDU has the following format: DA, SA, and length, followed by an LLC header. Each sub-frame is rounded up to be a multiple of four bytes (with a padding of 0-3 bytes). Note that any padding is not reflected in the packet length field in the sub-frame header.   
Refer to `Figure 9-54—A-MSDU structure` and `Figure 9-55—Basic A-MSDU subframe structure`. Subframe include DA and SA.

#### 12.3.802.11ax (highly effective) features 

 Increased spectral frequency reuse and manage interference between OBSS (**Adaptive CCA** (MAC))  
 Support of outdoor WLAN operation (stationary or pedestrian speeds) (4x longer orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM))  
 4x throughput improvement in a dense environment (**DL/UL OFDMA, DL/UL MU-MIMO**)  

The bands of operation are 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The salient features of 802.11ax are as follows:  
 DL OFDMA  
 UL OFDMA  
 UL MU-MIMO  
 Outdoor channel support (4x symbol duration)

##### 12.3.1.MU-MIMO

11ax introduced DL MU-MIMO. Up to 4 users are spatially multiplexed. 11ax increases DL MU-MIMO to 8 users spatially multiplexed. 11ax also introduces UL MU-MIMO. Up to 8 users are spatially multiplexed. MU-MIMO on top of OFDMA allows communication to more users at the same time.

<font color="#FF8C00">11ax UL MU-MIMO :  </font>   
<img src="/img/post/2023-07-31-11ax-UL-MU-MIMO.png"/>   

AP transmits a trigger frame soliciting the transmission of UL MU PPDU from multiple STAs. STAs transmit UL MU (OFDMA or MU-MIMO) PPDU as immediate response to the trigger frame. AP transmits acknowledgment frame in response to UL MU PPDU. Trigger frame is needed for:  
 Time synchronization among MU STAs based on the end of the trigger PPDU  
 Frequency offset correction based on the common AP reference from the trigger  
 Providing duration and PPDU length of UL transmission  
 Providing ID information of the STAs that are allowed to transmit, inclusive of spatial streams/tone allocation  
 Providing power control information  

**UL MU PPDU**  
 UL PPDU can be multiplexed using OFDMA or MU- MIMO.  
 IFS between the Trigger frame and UL MU PPDUs is SIFS.  

##### 12.3.2.11AX OFDMA  

11ax OFDMA resource units:  
 RU sizes: 26 / 52 / 106/ 242 / 484 tones  
 26-tone RU is about 2MHz wide  
 Narrowband transmission has longer range  
 May use different size RUs in the same PPDU  
 Max RUs: 9 (20MHz), 18 (40MHz), 37 (80MHz), 74 (160MHz)

<img src="/img/post/2023-07-31-40MHz-BSS-Resource-unit.png"/>    

##### 12.3.3.UL OFDMA  

- AP sends trigger frame by contending with AC_BE.    
- Trigger frame is transmitted by MCS 0, duplicated format in every 20 MHz channels (assuming 74-bytes long).    
- STAs are allocated using trigger frame send data frames. MCS, transmission sub-band, and maximum frame length of data frame are addressed in the trigger frame. If the station does not have any queued data frame, it does not send anything. If the station does not have enough data frame to fill maximum frame length, it adds padding bits to data frame.
- STAs do not perform CCA.  
- AP sends each BA frame in same sub-band with its data frame. BA frame is transmitted by MCS 0.  
- Contending of STAs is not permitted

##### 12.3.5.Adaptive CCA  

Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) is fixed in current IEEE amendments. **However, theoretically, it is better to adapt CCA, for each BSS, to an optimum level that depends on the locations of the STA vs the AP, and neighboring BSS/OBSS.** For instance, in this BSS, the STAs backoff if they receive a frame from any node within their coverage.   
However, based on the location of the nodes in this BSS, they can adopt a CCA > -82dBm until the AP receives all the STAs that are above the new CCA or until the STAs defer to each other based on the new CCA value (preferably). Adapting the CCA level should consider potential STAs nearby. In below, adopting a CCA>-82dBm by either of BSS is less likely to hurt the operation of the other BSS significantly.

#### 13.Transmit beamforming (TxBF)  

**beamformee**: A station (STA) that **receives** a physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) that was transmitted using a beamforming steering matrix.  
**beamformer**: A station (STA) that **transmits** a physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) using a beamforming steering matrix.  
**beamforming**: A spatial filtering mechanism used at a transmitter to improve the received signal power or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at an intended receiver. Syn: beam steering.   

This section describes the software for Transmit Beamforming (TxBF). It includes an introduction and a software flow.   
To calculate an appropriate steering matrix for transmit spatial processing when transmitting to a specific beamformee, the beamformer needs to have an accurate estimate of the channel that it is transmitting over. **There are two methods for BF: implicit feedback and explicit feedback.** Only explicit feedback is supported.  

**Explicit feedback TxBF**  
**When using explicit feedback, the beamformee makes a direct estimate of the channel from training symbols sent to the beamformee by the beamformer. The beamformee may prepare Channel State Information or Steering feedback (compressed or non compressed) based on an observation of these training symbols. The beamformee quantizes the feedback and sends it to the beamformer. The beamformer can use the feedback as the basis for determining transmit steering vectors.**

<font color="#FF8C00">Software flow for explicit TxBF:  </font>    
<img src="/img/post/2023-07-31-Software-flow-for-explicit-TxBF.png"/> 

**Sounding PPDU:**    
Sounding PPDUs are transmitted by STAs to enable the receiving STAs to estimate the channel between the transmitting STA and the receiving STA. The sounding PPDU should be set to 0 (Not Sounding) in the HT-SIG field. Send the proper extension HT_LTF for training BF.

**Beamforming software flow**  
The software flow for BF can be divided into the following: initialization, after new association, Tx rate adaption, Tx descriptor setting, Tx descriptor status handling, Rx descriptor handling, Rx frame parsing, and CV update mechanism.  

#### 14.TWT

Negotiation of implicit Target Wake Time (TWT) sessions, including handling of TWT information elements, is supported. Host-side enhancements are implemented for AP TWT.   
**To reduce the consequences of channel contention,** the TWT mechanism included in the IEEE 802.11ax amendment facilitates an easy and effective mechanism to schedule transmissions in time. Apart from reducing the contention between stations, the use of TWT also enables other mechanisms in the IEEE 802.11 universe, such as multiuser transmissions, multi-AP cooperation, spatial reuse andcoexistence in high-density WLAN scenarios to be leveraged.   
The TWT mechanism in IEEE 802.11ax is based on the implementation in IEEE 802.11ah. **In addition to the Individual TWT mode, it also includes a new Broadcast TWT mode.** It is expected that this new mode will be able to improve the efficiency of the TWT operation and leverage the new multiuser capabilities of 802.11ax. **With the individual TWT mechanism, stations can agree with the AP on a common wake scheduling, allowing them to wake up only when required, hence to minimize energy consumption and contention within the Basic Service Set (BSS).**
To initiate a TWT session, a negotiation phase occurs at first in which the AP and the target station agree on a common set of parameters. The significant parameters are as follows:

 **Target Wake Time (TWT)**: The next point in time, in microseconds, at which the station participating in the TWT-based communication must wake up for the TWT session.  
 **TWT Wake interval**: The time interval between subsequent TWT sessions for the station; the value is higher than 0 when the TWT is periodic.  
 **Minimum TWT awake duration**: Minimum time duration a station must stay awake since the starting time of the TWT session so as to be able to receive frames from the other stations.  
 **TWT Channel**: The channel a station can use temporarily as the primary one.  
 **TWT Protection**: Mechanism employed to protect a TWT session from transmissions of external stations, such as the RTS/CTS.   

**The TWT timing can be explicit or implicit**: while the former requires specification of the TWT parameters before each new session, the latter allows to set periodic sessions by relying on the first set of parameters until a new set is received. After the TWT parameters are agreed, the stations can go to sleep until the next TWT session is reached. In practice, each station can establish up to 8 TWT sessions with the AP.

##### 14.1.Individual TWT

Single TWT session negotiated between AP and a STA. **This ensures a specific Service period of DL and UL between AP and STA with traffic limited within the negotiated SP of 99% accuracy**. 
The service period starts at specific offset from the **target beacon transmission time (TBTT)** and runs for the SP duration and repeats every SP interval. Between an AP and STA, a maximum of 8 sessions are supported with different flow and SP parameters.
**The STA can choose to go to sleep the rest of the time, thereby saving power**.  

##### 14.2.Solicited TWT

STA initiated TWT sessions.  

<font color="#FF8C00">Solicited TWT:  </font>    
<img src="/img/post/2023-07-31-Solicited-TWT.png"/>  

Unsolicited TWT： AP initiated TWT setup with STA. AP sends TWT response with service period which the STA has to accept.  
Unannounced TWT： AP can send frames to STA without any trigger from STA as soon as the SP starts.  
Non-triggered TWT： STA does not need wait for AP’s trigger frames before it can send frames to AP.  
Implicit TWT： STA calculates the next SP start time by adding a fixed value (TWT Interval) to the current TWT value (SP start) to indicate in the field next_twt.  

##### 14.3.Smart AP TWT – Congestion-based STA binning

TWT SP (Service Period) is the period of time during which TWT STA wakes up to transmit and receive frames.
Target Wake Time (Tstart) is the offset after which the first TWT SP will start. Nominal TWT Wake Duration (Tdur) is the nominal TWT slot duration, and TWT Wake Interval(Tintvl) is the interval between two successive TWT SP.  
SP start time is thus defined with sequence: T1 = Tstart, T2 = T1+Tdur+Tintvl, T3 = T2+Tdur+Tintvl , …

#### 15.Off-channel Tx and Rx  

Off-channel Tx feature enables sending frames on a different channel than the current operating channel. This functionality uses scan mechanism to go to foreign channel and then sends the frame.   
  
The off-channel Tx component performs the following:  
 This module receives request from external entity to send frames on foreign channel.  
 This module interacts with scan module to go to foreign channel using scan infrastructure and send out the frame requested.  
 It uses send_mgmt API to send a frame.  
	
	wlan_offchan_txrx_request()

#### 16.Software Retry(SWR)  

Software Retry (SWR) is a mechanism to allow software to re-transmit one frame, in addition to hardware transmissions.   
In the Qualcomm Technologies legacy Fusion driver, **a frame (either non-AMPDU or AMPDU) is put into the hardware queue for transmission, and might be transmitted multiple times until a success occurs with different rates (that is, hardware retry) depending on the TX descriptor set by the Rate Adaptation algorithm. After the hardware finishes transmitting a frame** (either success or failure), it will raise an interrupt to notify the software, which then performs any post-processing of this frame:
 For a successful frame, software completes the frame and releases the buffer.
 For a failed non-AMPDU frame: software completes the frame and releases buffer.
 For a failed AMPDU frame: In case of aggregation, the failed frame in the aggregate will be put back into the TIC queue for further transmissions, which is handled by the Block-ACK mechanism.  

SWR retries the failed non-AMPDU frame (also called SWR eligible frame) at the software level; that is, putting it back in the TID queue again.  
SWR is especially useful in the following scenarios:  
When the STA transitions from active mode to PS mode, there might be frames already in the hardware queue that will be lost if STA goes to sleep suddenly. In such a case, these lost frames should be retried later (placing them in the hardware queue again) instead of completing them and releasing the buffer.   


#### 17.Beacon protection(BIP)   

Beacon Protection feature as part of BIP - Broadcast/Multicast Integrity Protocol is now supported. When Management Frame Protection (MFP) is negotiated, all group addressed robust management frames are encapsulated using procedures defined in this document. This service provides data integrity protection and replay protection of group addressed management frames and this feature is specifically for Beacons.  

BIP provides data integrity and replay protection for group addressed robust Management frames after establishment of an Integrity Group Temporal Key (IGTK) security association (IGTKSA) and for Beacon frames after establishment of a Beacon Integrity Group Temporal Key SA (BIGTKSA).  
BIP uses the BIGTK to compute the MMPDU MIC. the authenticator may distribute one new BIGTK and BIPN when it distributes a new GTK. The BIGTK is identified by the MAC address of the transmitting STA plus a BIGTK identifier that is encoded in the MME Key ID field.  
**BIGTK is exchanged to the STA by AP during M1-M4 exchange.**    

#### 18.Channel width management (CWM)  

When the AP receives an 802.11 action frame from the wireless network, the function `ieee80211_recv_action()` is called. This function checks to see if the action frame is of the PUBLIC subtype and the action is 0 (HT40Intolerant), or if the action frame is of the HT subtype and the action is a channel width change. If so, it calls the Channel Width Management state machine to change the channel width.  


#### 19.Agile DFS 

When an AP finds radar in a channel, it has to stop operating in the channel and move to a new channel. AP has to perform CAC if it is a DFS channel. There is loss of connectivity during CAC. For various VHT modes, Qualcomm 802.11ax/802.11ac devices can tell the subchannels that are affected by radar. If radar does not overlap the 20Mhz subchannel where the AP is beaconing, it is possible to reduce the bandwidth (BW) of the AP and retain the beaconing channel.   This condition prevents CAC and loss of connectivity.  
When radar is detected in a subpart of the operating channel, the radio must continue in a narrower part of the same channel, but excluding the part of the channel in which the radar occurred. The bandwidth (BW) Agile DS feature prevents unnecessary switch to other channels and minimizes interruption time on detection of radar. It is applicable for 80+80 MHz, 80 MHz, and 40 MHz.  
No reduction of bandwidth when radar is injected on beaconing/primary channel. Bandwidth does not increase on removal of channels from NOL list.

#### 20.Rolling CAC  

In case of FCC and MKK domains, backup monitoring of one DFS channel (non-primary channel) is allowed. 
The Agile Detector are used to perform this operation. The backup monitoring must be a continuous time (infinite time) phenomenon on a given channel and is termed as “Rolling CAC (RCAC)”.
If radar is detected in the current operating channel and if the rolling CAC channel is radar free for at-least “the minimum CAC duration specified by the regulatory” , the RCAC channel can be chosen as the next channel. The AP can beacon immediately on the RCAC completed channel skipping CAC. 

Rolling CAC is the concept of performing a channel availability check (CAC) on a different channel (other than the primary operating channel) continuously till the primary channel change.   
With this feature, when the primary channel is switched to the rolling CAC channel, a separate primary CAC is not required, given the channel was free of radar in the last minute.  


#### 21.RTS Protection duration 

The following command allows to enable or disable SW RTS feature:
	wifitool athX setUnitTestCmd 0x48 2 314 <0-Disable/1-SU-RTS>

The following command allows to configure various protection types in UL OFDMA sequence:

#### 22.NOL (Non-Occupancy List)  

For the implementation of the NOL, two timers are implemented: NOL timeout timer and Channel Switch Announcement (CSA) timeout timer.  

`nol_timer`: This timer is used to refresh the NOL list every 5 seconds. If the NOL entry in the list is 30 mins old, the stale channel entry will be removed from the list. The `wal_dfs_nol_timeout_hdlr` callback is getting called to do the task when the timer fires.  

`csa_wait_timer`: This timer is used to turn off the Tx after radar is detected in the current channel. This timer is configured to fire after 500ms from the time radar is detected. The `wal_dfs_csa_wait_timeout_
hdlr` is getting called to turn off the Tx.  

#### 23.RF sensing features

The RF sensing features, such as generation of channel frequency response (CFR) dump for supported platforms, CFR with unassociated clients and AoA phase calibration data and support for CFR capture on STA VAPs. This capability is also called channel state information (CSI) collection.   

#### 24.6GHz band feature

The 6-GHz frequency band, also called mid-band spectrum, spans 5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz. It is divided into four bands:  
 U-NII-5: 5925-6425 MHz (standard power levels, AFC applies)  
 U-NII-6: 6425-6525 MHz (low power, indoor only)  
 U-NII-7: 6525-6875 MHz (standard power levels, AFC applies)

802.11 specification mandates that all Pre-RSNA security methods are to be deprecated. Open Security is to be replaced with OWE, password-based authentication should use SAE, and the Enterprise Security here is Suite-B/Suite-B-192. PMF is mandatory in 6 GHz. In addition to these requirements, WFA certification requires the following:  
 WPA3 Personal Transition modes (SAE+PSK2)   
 OWE Transition mode (Open+OWE)   
 WPA3-SAE  

#### 25.Rate control  

Rate Control is the algorithm used by the WLAN software to choose the rate for transmitting a frame to a STA.   
Rate Control estimates the best rate to use for transmission based on statistics collected from previous transmissions to that STA. It uses the best rate as the first (highest) rate of the rate series.   
This first and highest rate dictates the other rates and the retries in the rate series.For an offload data path, software must select a rate series, which consists of three rates for 20 MHz, 40 MHz and 80 MHz, and the number of attempts (retries). The rate series is used by the WLAN MAC hardware.  

The MAC Layer Throughput is given by the equation: MAC Layer Throughput = PHY Rate * (1- PER)

#### 26.WMM-PS  

WMM Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (UAPSD) is a power save mechanism specified by the WiFi Alliance WMM specification. UAPSD mechanism **applies to unicast QoS Data and QoS Null data frames only**. This mechanism provides quicker way to retrieve the buffered frames in the AP for a STA in power save mode. This section describes the UAPSD operation and implementation details. Refer to the WMM specification document for more details on UAPSD operation.   

**Terminology for WMM-PS**：  
 AC (Access category): A label for the common set of enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) parameters that are used by a WMM STA to contend for the channel in order to transmit MSDUs with certain priorities. WMM defines 4 ACs.
 Delivery-enabled AC: An AC for a specific STA, to deliver traffic in that STA-specific AC using WMM when an Unscheduled Service Period (USP) is triggered by that STA.  
 Service Period (SP): A service period is a contiguous time during which one or more downlink unicast frames are transmitted to a WMM STA and/or one or more TXOPs are granted to the same WMM STA. Service Periods can be scheduled or unscheduled. For a WMM STA, there can be at most one Service Period active at any time.  
 Trigger-enabled AC: An AC for a specific STA to initiate an Unscheduled Service Period (USP), if one is not already in progress, when frames are received from that STA are of subtype QoS Data or QoS Null associated with that AC.  
 Trigger Frame: A QoS Data or QoS Null frame from a WMM STA in Power Save Mode associated with an AC the WMM STA has configured to be a trigger-enabled AC. A QoS Data or QoS Null frame that indicates transition to/from Power Save Mode is not considered to be a Trigger Frame and the AP does not respond with a QoS Null frame.   
 Unscheduled Service Period (USP): The Service Period that is started when a WMM STA transmits a trigger frame to the WMM AP.   


**WMM-PS Theory of operation**:  
The UAPSD mechanism used by the STA retrieves unicast QoS traffic buffered in the AP by sending trigger frames. During association/re-association, a STA indicates (in the QoS Info field) which Access Categories are UAPSD enabled. For non-UAPSD enabled ACs, the STA shall use PS-Polls as a means to retrieve the legacy power-save buffered frames.  
For a UAPSD-enabled AC, the AP will respond to a trigger by sending up to a maxSP number of frames. The last QoS data frame shall have the End of Service Period (EOSP) bit set to indicate the end of the service period. If the AP has no buffered frames for any delivery-enabled ACs, it responds with a QoS NULL frame with the EOSP bit set. The AP is compliant with the WMM Power Save Specification and is required to pass the WMM Power Save certification.

#### 27.Power Save Poll  

**Traffic Indication Message**: The TIM information element is present only within the beacon frames generated by AP. It indicates the presence of buffered data to the associated STAs.   

**Delivery Traffic Indication Message**: The DTIM is a kind of TIM that informs the STA about the presence of buffered 
multicast/broadcast frames at the AP. It is generated within the periodic beacon at a frequency specified by DTIM interval.    

**Listen Interval**: The listen interval is used by the STA to indicate to an AP how often a STA in power save mode wakes to listen to beacon frames. The value of this parameter is expressed in units of beacon interval. The AP may use this listen interval information in determining the lifetime of frames that is buffered for a STA.  

#### 28.PAPRD functionality

When a packet is transmitted over the over air, the signal can be distorted at various places. The transmit frame goes through the MAC, digital baseband, and finally a DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter).   
This analog baseband signal is amplified before feeding to antenna. Ideally, the Power Amplifier (PA) must have zero signal distortion. While designs with external PAs show good linearity and low distortion, designs which use the internal PA show significant distortion at higher signal powers. This feature tries to address the distortion in the internal Power Amplifier of the transmitter. The PAPRD (Power Amplifier PRe-Distortion) algorithm is used to reduce this signal distortion digitally using a combination of software and hardware processes. The algorithm is
applied **only on the designs that use internal PAs**.   
 

##### 28.1.Implementation of PAPRD  

In general, the software needs to perform the following tasks to for the PAPRD algorithm:  
 Set up chip in PAPRD training mode.  
 Send training packets for one individual chain at a time.  
 Capture hardware loopback signal samples  
 Run the software algorithm to derive the PAPRD Calibration Information  
 Store this PAPRD CAL information into software data structure  
 Apply captured PAPRD CAL to chip   
 Re-apply PAPRD CAL if chip is reset  

##### 28.2.PAPRD Training  

The PAPRD training is closely tied to the generic calibration function, ath_calibrate(), which runs as a timer thread and starts various calibrations like NF cal, IQ cal, and so on. This function runs every 2 seconds in the STA mode and every 200 ms in the AP mode till the calibration is done.  
Once calibration is complete, ath_calibrate is called every 30 seconds in the STA and AP modes.  
After successful completion of PAPRD training, the PAPRD per chain CAL table is saved and applied by calling `ath_apply_paprd_table()`. PAPRD CA L is retained for the current channel training was done. If a channel change is done, PAPRD training will start again on the new channel.  
PAPRD training packets are sent by calling `ath_sendpaprd_single()`. Details of training packet are as follows:  

	pkt len = 1800 bytes
	Data rate: 54Mbps.
	Frame Type: Data.
	Number of PAPRD Training frame per chain: 1

	 ath_paprd_cal
		Set HAL into PAPRD CAL mode and send training packets.
	 ath_apply_paprd_table
		This call writes PAPRD CAL table to baseband registers.
