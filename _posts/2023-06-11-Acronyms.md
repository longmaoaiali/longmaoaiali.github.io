# 前言

整理WLAN，网络相关的专业术语和首字母缩写。

#### Number
802.1Q: Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges and Virtual Bridge Local Area Networks  
802.11W: Protected Management Frames  
802.11V: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network Management  
802.11D: Amendment 3: Specification for operation in additional regulatory domains  

#### ABCD
ACL: Access Control List. ACL defining policy and related actions for specific flow.  
AMSDU: Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit  
BSRP: Buffer Status Report Poll  
BSR: Buffer Status Report   
BQRP: Bandwidth Query Report Poll  
Butler: Butler matrix is a beamforming network used to feed a phased array of antenna elements. Its purpose is to control the direction of a beam, or beams, of radio transmission (achieve cable MIMO).  


CVLAN: Customer network VLANs, also called inner VLANs, refer to VLANs that a customer uses on the private network.
CTPID STPID: TPID settings include CVLAN TPID and SVLAN TPID. A QinQ-enabled port uses the CVLAN TPID to match incoming tagged frames.  
CS: customer sample  
CLPC: closed loop power control   
 

DL MU: Downlink multi-user  
DSCP: Differentiated Services Code Point   





#### EFGH
ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute  
ES: engineer sample  
ED: Engineer Drop  

FC: feature complete  
FCC: Federal Communications Commission  
FDB (forwarding data base) is also called Address Resolution Lookup (ARL) table or MAC table by the other vendors.  
 
HE TB PPDU: high-efficiency (HE) trigger-based (TB) physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU): A PPDU transmitted with HE TB PPDU format.   
HDS (Hardware decision sequencer): The HDS binary (Hardware decision sequencer) is a debug binary that would consist of the sequence of execution of functions in HALPHY.   

#### IJKL

#### MNOP
MIC: Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications  
MU-RTS: Multi-user request to send  

NAWDS: The Non-Association WDS (NAWDS) is an AP feature that provides an alternative WDS solution that does not require any association between peer NAWDS APs. A NAWDS AP could be statically configured to receive WDS packets from and send packets to peer NAWDS APs.  

OLPC: open loop power control  


#### QRST
QoS: Quality of service  
QMF: quality-of-service management frame  

RESMGR: Resource Manager  
Remote procedure framework: See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/remoteproc.txt for more information. This is a standard framework provided by the Linux kernel to do power-on and power-off through registered callbacks for the target processor.  


SIFS: short interframe space  
SVLAN: Service provider network VLANs, also called outer VLANs, refer to VLANs that a service provider uses to transmit VLAN tagged traffic for customers.SVLAN TPIDs are configurable on a per-port basis. A service provider-side port uses the SVLAN TPID to replace the TPID in outgoing frames SVLAN tags and match incoming tagged frames.  


TOS: Type of Service  
TSO: TCP segmentation offload (TSO) is an optimization technique that reduces the CPU overhead in TCP/IP-related network operations. With TSO enabled, a network internet controller (NIC) splits large data chunks traveling over a network into smaller TCP segments. Without TSO, the segmentation is performed by the CPU, which creates an overhead. TSO is also known as LSO (Large Segment Offload).   


#### UVW
U-APSD: unscheduled automatic power save delivery  
VLAN TCI: VLAN Tag Control Information  
VSI: Virtual switch interface  
VLAN TPID: TPID identifies a frame as an 802.1Q tagged frame.  

Wi-Fi (WLAN that uses the IEEE 802.11 standard)  
WAPI: WLAN Authentication & Privacy Infrastructure   


#### XYZ
