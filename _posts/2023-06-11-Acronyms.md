	802.11a: OFDM PHY specification for the 5 GHz band
	802.11n(Clause 19): High-throughput (HT) PHY specification
	802.11ac(Clause 21): Very high throughput (VHT) PHY specification
	802.11ax(Clause 27): High-efficiency (HE) PHY specification
	802.1Q: Media Access Control (MAC) Bridges and Virtual Bridge Local Area Networks  
	802.11W: Protected Management Frames  
	802.11V: IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network Management  
	802.11D: Amendment 3: Specification for operation in additional regulatory domains  

#### ABCD
A

	ACL: Access Control List. ACL defining policy and related actions for specific flow.  
	AMSDU: Aggregated MAC Service Data Unit  

B  

	BSRP: Buffer Status Report Poll  
	BSR: Buffer Status Report   
	BQRP: Bandwidth Query Report Poll  
	Butler: Butler matrix is a beamforming network used to feed a phased array of antenna elements. Its purpose is to control the direction of a beam, or beams, of radio transmission (achieve cable MIMO).  

C

	CVLAN: Customer network VLANs, also called inner VLANs, refer to VLANs that a customer uses on the private network.
	CTPID STPID: TPID settings include CVLAN TPID and SVLAN TPID. A QinQ-enabled port uses the CVLAN TPID to match incoming tagged frames.  
	CS: customer sample  
	CLPC: closed loop power control   

D

	DL MU: Downlink multi-user  
	DSCP: Differentiated Services Code Point   
	DFT/IDFT: Inverse discrete Fourier transform





#### EFGH
E

	ETSI: European Telecommunications Standards Institute  
	ES: engineer sample  
	ED: Engineer Drop  
	EMA AP: enhanced multiple basic service set identifier (BSSID) advertisement (EMA) access point (AP):	

F

	FC: feature complete  
	FCC: Federal Communications Commission  
	FDB (forwarding data base) is also called Address Resolution Lookup (ARL) table or MAC table by the other vendors.  

G

	GI: guard interval durations

H
 	
	HE TB PPDU: high-efficiency (HE) trigger-based (TB) physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU): A PPDU transmitted with HE TB PPDU format.   
	HDS (Hardware decision sequencer): The HDS binary (Hardware decision sequencer) is a debug binary that would consist of the sequence of execution of functions in HALPHY.   
	HE-LTF: HE-long training field

#### IJKL
I

	ISI: Inter-Symbol Interference 

J

K

L

#### MNOP
M

	MIC: Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications  
	MU-RTS: Multi-user request to send  
	MU-BAR: multi-user block ack request

N

	NAWDS: The Non-Association WDS (NAWDS) is an AP feature that provides an alternative WDS solution that does not require any association between peer NAWDS APs. A NAWDS AP could be statically configured to receive WDS packets from and send packets to peer NAWDS APs. 
	NTBR (non-TB ranging): A ranging measurement procedure that uses NDP, and is not initiated by a Ranging Trigger frame, refer to 802.11az-2022.pdf 

O

	OLPC: open loop power control  


#### QRST
Q

	QoS: Quality of service  
	QMF: quality-of-service management frame  
	QRTR: It used to be called as IPC route(Inter process communication router as it uses sockets to communicate)  

R

	RESMGR: Resource Manager  
	Remote procedure framework: See https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/remoteproc.txt for more information. This is a standard framework provided by the Linux kernel to do power-on and power-off through registered callbacks for the target processor.  

S

	SIFS: short interframe space  
	SVLAN: Service provider network VLANs, also called outer VLANs, refer to VLANs that a service provider uses to transmit VLAN tagged traffic for customers.SVLAN TPIDs are configurable on a per-port basis. A service provider-side port uses the SVLAN TPID to replace the TPID in outgoing frames SVLAN tags and match incoming tagged frames.  

T

	TOS: Type of Service  
	TSO: TCP segmentation offload (TSO) is an optimization technique that reduces the CPU overhead in TCP/IP-related network operations. With TSO enabled, a network internet controller (NIC) splits large data chunks traveling over a network into smaller TCP segments. Without TSO, the segmentation is performed by the CPU, which creates an overhead. TSO is also known as LSO (Large Segment Offload).   


#### UVW
U

	U-APSD: unscheduled automatic power save delivery  

V

	VLAN TCI: VLAN Tag Control Information  
	VSI: Virtual switch interface  
	VLAN TPID: TPID identifies a frame as an 802.1Q tagged frame.  

W

	Wi-Fi (WLAN that uses the IEEE 802.11 standard)  
	WAPI: WLAN Authentication & Privacy Infrastructure   
	WTS: Wireless test suit
