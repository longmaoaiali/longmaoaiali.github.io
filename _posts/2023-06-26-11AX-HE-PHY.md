## HE PHY Overview

----------
### 1 HE PHY Feature

The HE PHY extends the maximum number of users supported for DL MU-MIMO transmissions to 8 users per resource unit (RU) and provides support for DL and UL orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) as well as for UL MU-MIMO. **Support UL MU-MIMO, DL MU-MIMO, UL OFDMA, DL OFDMA.**
	
The HE PHY provides support for 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz contiguous channel widths and support for 80+80 MHz noncontiguous **channel width**.

For PPDU bandwidths greater than or equal to 80 MHz, the HE PHY supports **preamble punctured HE MU PPDU transmissions** where pre-HE modulated fields (see Figure 27-23 in 27.3.10) are not transmitted in one or more of the nonprimary 20 MHz channels, and RUs associated with those punctured 20 MHz channels as defined in 27.3.11.8.3 are not allocated

The HE PHY **data subcarrier frequency spacing** is a quarter of VHT PHY and HT PHY subcarrier frequency spacing defined in Clause 21 and Clause 19, respectively.

The HE PHY data subcarriers are **modulated** using BPSK, BPSK DCM, QPSK, QPSK DCM, 16-QAM, 16-QAM DCM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and 1024-QAM. Forward error correction (FEC) coding (convolutional or LDPC coding) is used with **coding rates** of 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, and 5/6.

The HE PHY provides support for **midambles**. Midambles facilitate updating of the channel estimate during HE PPDU reception and might be of use in high mobility scenarios that often result in significant variations of the wireless channel over the duration of a PPDU.
An HE STA may include midambles in an HE PPDU transmission in fast varying channels, i.e., channels with high Doppler, to facilitate channel estimation update during the PPDU. **The recipient might use the midambles to compensate the channel estimation if it is varying fast in channels with high Doppler.** Midambles are inserted only if NSTS ≤ 4.

### 2 GI (guard interval durations)

The HE PHY provides support for 0.8 µs, 1.6 µs, and 3.2 µs guard interval durations.
	
	/* Guard Intervals */
	enum WHAL_GI_E {
    	WHAL_GI_800,
    	WHAL_GI_400,
    	WHAL_GI_1600,
    	WHAL_GI_3200,
    	WHAL_GI_CNT,
	};
	
#### 2.1 The purpose of inserting GI

Determine the length of the GI according to the GI_TYPE parameter of the TXVECTOR. Refer to 19.3.11.11 and 19.3.11.12 for details.
In the PHY, the GI with GI duration indicated in GI_TYPE parameter of the TXVECTOR is inserted in every data OFDM symbol as a countermeasure against delay spread.

against delay spread: Refer to [delay spread](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/515351041)
Different symbols interfere with each other, which is Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).
In order to avoid ISI, the symbol duration needs to be longer than the delay spread time, so in OFDM system, consider inserting a guard interval (GI) between the preceding and following symbols.

### 3 HE-LTF (HE-long training field) symbol durations

The HE PHY provides support for 3.2 µs (1x), 6.4 µs (2x), and 12.8 µs (4x) HE-LTF symbol durations, excluding the GI duration.

	/* HE-LTF Modes */
	enum WHAL_HE_LTF_E {
    	WHAL_HE_LTF_DEFAULT,
    	WHAL_HE_LTF_1X,
    	WHAL_HE_LTF_2X,
    	WHAL_HE_LTF_4X,
    	WHAL_HE_LTF_CNT,
	};

#### 3.1 Effects of HE-LTF

The HE-LTF field provides a means for the receiver to estimate the MIMO channel between the set of constellation mapper outputs (or, if STBC is applied, the STBC encoder outputs) and the receive chains.
An HE transmission has a preamble that contains HE-LTF symbols, where the data tones of each HE-LTF symbol are multiplied by entries belonging to a matrix P, to enable channel estimation at the receiver.

### 4 DFT/IDFT (Inverse discrete Fourier transform) period
	
The HE PHY supports a DFT period of 3.2 µs and 12.8 µs for the pre-HE modulated fields and the HE modulated fields in an HE PPDU, respectively.   
OFDM（正交频分复用）在宽带无线通信中有重要的应用。这种技术将带宽分为N个等间隔的子载波，可以证明这些子载波相互正交。尤其重要的是，OFDM调制可以由IDFT实现，而解调可以由DFT实现.
