### 1.MLO Demo

#### 1.1.MLO Demo Diagram 

> An example of an AP MLD with two affiliated APs (Link 1 and Link 2) is shown in Figure 4-30a (Example MLD and the affiliated STA communication system). The figure shows an AP MLD with MLD MAC address M and the MLD lower MAC sublayers of two affiliated APs (AP1 with MAC address w and AP2 with MAC address x). The AP MLD is associated with a non-AP MLD with MLD MAC address P and the MLD lower MAC sublayers of two affiliated non-AP STAs (non-AP STA1 with MAC 
address y and non-AP STA2 with MAC address z) are shown. 

> Link 1 is established between AP1 and non-AP STA1 and link 2 is established between AP2 and non-AP STA2. **In general, the MAC address of an MLD and the MAC addresses of the STAs affiliated with the MLD are all different (e.g., M, P, w, x, y, and z have different values). However, the architecture supports an implementation where M could equal either w or x, and where P could equal y or z.**

These BSS configuration options will update to beacon frame.

#### 2.3.MLD How to select Primary Link?  

In the 802.11 protocol, only NSTR mentions the primary link.  

>35.3.19 NSTR mobile AP MLD operation  
An NSTR mobile AP MLD shall designate one of the links of an NSTR link pair as the primary link. The other link of the NSTR link pair is the nonprimary link. When the NSTR mobile AP MLD intends to change the channel/operating class for the primary link, it shall perform (#16959)the channel switch procedure. The NSTR mobile AP MLD shall schedule for transmissions of Beacon and Probe Response frames and group addressed Data frames only on the primary link. 

<font color="#FF0000"> Approach:  
Use the assoc link as the primary link, STA MLD decides which link to connect and configure the primary umac. When AP MLD receive Auth frame, AP MLD will configure the primary umac on assoc link.</font>

#### 2.4.Which link EAPOL frame will be sent out?

<font color="#FF0000"> Assoc link, also primary link. </font>    
>A non-AP MLD shall perform frame exchanges during the authentication, (re)association, and 4-way handshake procedures only on the primary link of the NSTR mobile AP MLD.

#### 2.5. MLO with 2 links, one of links is disconnected, what is expected behavior? 
Spec has not defined to fallback to SLO by tearing down the MLO link nodes or continue MLO with just one link active. Both approaches have pros and cons.   
  
- Approach 1: Tear down MLO and go to SLO. If the client device moves close, we will still be SLO unless the upper layer initiates an MLO connection. 
- Approach 2: Continue MLO with single link active. We carry overhead of maintaining and logistics in software (ex: ml_peer_ids, peer management, rx reordering) for MLD link even though the user is single link active and we donâ€™t know when STA will come back to range for MLO. 

Currently we are with approach 1 to tear down MLO and stay with legacy connection.
