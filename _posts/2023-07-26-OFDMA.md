### 1.Acronyms

**CBF**: Compressed Beamforming   
**TxBF**: Transmit beamforming     
**MIMO**: Multiple-input and Multiple-output  
**high-throughput (HT) null data packet (NDP) announcement**: A physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) that contains one or more +HTC frames (i.e., frames with an HT Control field) that have the HT NDP Announcement subfield equal to 1.  
**null data packet (NDP)**: A physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) that carries no Data field.   
**multi-user (MU) beamformer**: An access point (AP) that transmits a physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) using a multi-user beamforming steering matrix.    
**beamformee**: A station (STA) that **receives** a physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) that was transmitted using a beamforming steering matrix.  
**beamformer**: A station (STA) that **transmits** a physical layer (PHY) protocol data unit (PPDU) using a beamforming steering matrix.  
**beamforming**: A spatial filtering mechanism used at a transmitter to improve the received signal power or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at an intended receiver. Syn: beam steering.   
**beamforming steering matrix**: A matrix determined using knowledge of the channel between a transmitter and an intended receiver that maps from space-time streams to transmit antennas with the goal of **improving the signal power or signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the intended receiver.**  
**NFRP**: NDP feedback report poll   
**BRPOLL**: Beamforming Report Poll  
**CBF**: Compressed Beamforming report
**BAR**: BlockAckReq  
**BA**: BlockAck  
**orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)**: An orthogonal frequency division multiple (OFDM)-based multiple access technique by which multiple stations (STAs) either simultaneously transmit to a single STA or simultaneously receive from a single STA independent data streams over different groups of subcarriers.  
**BQR**: bandwidth query report  
**BQRP**: bandwidth query report poll  
**BFRP**: beamforming report poll  
**BSR**: buffer status report  
**BSRP**: buffer status report poll  
**Traffic Identifier (TID)**: An identifier used to classify a packet in Wireless LAN. A QoS-enabled MAC layer of 802.11 protocol stack uses the TIDs to classify and prioritizes processing of incoming or outgoing frames.
